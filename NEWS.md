# susometa 0.1.0

Split `get_answer_options()` into two functions:

- `get_answer_options()` returns a named numeric vector, where the values are answer codes and names are value labels.
- `get_ms_answers_as_var_labels()` serves a use case for labelling multi-select variables in exported data or display tables.

# susometa 0.0.0.9000

Initial version. Preserved to lock in old functionality of `get_answer_options()` for reproducibility.
